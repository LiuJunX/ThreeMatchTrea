# Player Review: Bomb Generation Logic (V1.3)
**Reviewer**: Alex (Veteran Player, 5000+ Levels Cleared)
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐✮ (4.5/5)

## First Impression
"Finally, a game that respects my fingers! The logic feels surprisingly solid. It fixes the biggest gripe I have with most Match-3 games: **'Why did the bomb spawn THERE?!'**"

## The Good (爽点)
*   **God-Tier Control (操作优先)**:
    *   "If I swap a piece to make a bomb, the bomb spawns exactly where I swapped. This is huge. In *Gardenscapes*, half the time the bomb spawns randomly and ruins my setup. This design lets me actually *plan* my combos."
*   **The "Spirit Bomb" Effect (Scrap Absorption)**:
    *   "This is my favorite part. When I make a massive T-shape or Cross, instead of the leftover pieces just popping weakly, they all get sucked into the main bomb? That's gonna feel SO punchy. It turns a 'waste' into a 'power-up' moment."
*   **Generosity (2x4 -> Double Rockets)**:
    *   "Most games would just give me one UFO or one Rocket for a 2x4 block and delete the rest. You guys are giving me TWO Rockets? That's 80 points of value vs 20. Feels like the game wants me to win."
*   **Anti-Frustration (Input Affinity)**:
    *   "The rule where it picks the shape *I touched* even if scores are tied? Genius. It means I'm never fighting the algorithm."

## The Bad (槽点 / 担忧)
*   **UFO Nerf? (Low Priority)**:
    *   "You put UFO (Propeller) at the bottom of the food chain (20 points)? In *Royal Match*, propellers are life-savers. Here, if I accidentally make a 4-line while trying to make a square, I get a Rocket instead. It might make 'Propeller Spam' strats harder to pull off. Hardcore players will like it, casuals might miss the auto-aim crutch."
*   **Complexity Overload**:
    *   "The 'Global Optimal Partitioning' sounds smart, but if I make a 6x6 blob, will I instantly understand *why* I got 6 Rainbows and 2 Rockets? As long as the result is 'More Boom', I'm happy, but don't make it too unpredictable."

## Verdict
"This is a **Skill-Based** generation system. It removes the RNG frustration (bad spawns) and rewards big brain plays (Double Rockets, Mega Matches). The 'Scrap Absorption' is the cherry on top—it adds that visceral 'Juice' I'm always looking for. **Ship it.**"
